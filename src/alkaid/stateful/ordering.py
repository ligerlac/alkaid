    """Order combinational connections so that every read happens after its write.

    Each conn drives its ``dst`` view from up to three reads (``src``,
    ``alt_src``, ``enable_if``); the bit range of each is taken straight from the
    signal view (``view_interval``).  A conn must run after every conn that
    drives a bit it reads, so the result is a topological order of the
    read-after-write dependency graph.  The order within each disconnected
    subgraph is preserved; subgraphs may interleave freely.

    Dependencies are tracked at *interval* granularity rather than per signal, so
    e.g. ``A[0:10] = B`` together with ``B[10:20] = A`` is not a loop -- the bits
    do not overlap.  Combinational-logic ports ``~name:in`` / ``~name:out`` are
    contracted into one node: every output bit is assumed to depend on every
    input bit, so reading any output bit waits on writing any input bit.

    Raises:
        ValueError: on a combinational loop, or a double assignment (two conns
            driving overlapping bits of the same signal).
